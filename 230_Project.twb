              <bucket>&quot;@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80\% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp;amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp;amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target.&quot;</bucket>

Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp;amp; not lose money.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;@TeslaTested That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;@cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp;amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is.&quot;</bucket>

And why would a group that claims to be pro-environment oppose a sustainable energy factory? Aren’t there more important issues?&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;@Teslarati This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp;amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;@WholeMarsBlog What has become absolutely clear is that the plethora of self-driving corner cases can only be solved with real-world optical intelligence.

              <bucket>&quot;@wintonARK Strange, if true.   - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.  - A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?&quot;</bucket>
